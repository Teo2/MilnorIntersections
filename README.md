Abstract: The first non-zero mu-bar-invariant can be obtained iteratively intersecting Seifert surfaces and then counting signed intersections. We develop an alternative method involving counting certain subsequences of surfaces within the ordered list of surfaces the first link component crosses, avoiding needing to consider a bounding surface for this component.
